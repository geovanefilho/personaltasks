Parental Control Service
===

**ASSUMPTIONS**
As described in the README.md file of the exercise:

**Prevent access to movies based on parental control level**
*As a customer I donâ€™t want my account to be able to access movies that have a higher parental control level than my 
current preference setting.*

I assumed that movies with level lower and equals to the level defined in the user can be accessed.


IMPORTANT
---
* No data access was implemented due that the exercise does not require it.
* All hard code messages that I wrote should be internationalized
* I didn't change the methods in thirdparty package due to the exercise have told that would be implemented by another team. But I needed to add a Constructor in TechnicalFailureException so that I could throw it with my ParentalControlLevelException.


P.S.: Sorry for any typo in my writing. I'm improving my write in English yet.
